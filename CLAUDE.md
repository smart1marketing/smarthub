# Smart 1 Hub

Internal tool suite for Smart 1 Marketing. Flask, deployed on Render via
Docker, ~22 modules mounted under one login.

**Live:** https://smart1-hub.onrender.com · **Repo:** `Smart-1-Marketing/smarthub`

---

## Architecture in one page

`wsgi.py` is the entry point. It builds the hub app and mounts every module
through `DispatcherMiddleware`, wrapped in `AuthGuard` (login) and `HubBar`
(injects the sidebar, help layer and breadcrumbs into every response).

Modules attach one of two ways, and the difference matters:

1. **Dispatcher-mounted** — a standalone Flask app under a URL prefix
   (`/scans`, `/tools/seo-images`). Has its own Jinja environment.
2. **Blueprint-registered** — registered on the hub app itself
   (`modules/tickets`, `calculators`, `image_picker`, `page_image_optimizer`,
   `google_access`).

Shared services live in `hub/`: `config.py` (typed settings), `storage.py`
(Cloudinary), `ai.py` (OpenAI + cost tracking), `images.py`, `audit.py`
(activity log), `extensions.py` (the shared SQLAlchemy instance),
`jsonstore.py` (JSON on the disk, mirrored to the database),
`scheduler.py` (background jobs).

## Traps — every one of these has cost a working feature

**A hub route under a mounted prefix is unreachable.** DispatcherMiddleware
routes purely by URL prefix, so `@app.route("/sites/match")` on the hub app
never gets called — `/sites` belongs to Sites Admin. This has bitten three
times. `/api/integrity` has a high-severity check for it.

**Module Jinja environments are separate.** Globals registered on the hub app
are invisible inside a mounted module. `{{ help_dot(...) }}` in a module
template raises `UndefinedError` and 500s the page unless
`install_template_helpers()` ran for that app. Every helper call is written
`{{ help_dot('x') if help_dot is defined else '' }}` so a missing registration
degrades to a missing icon rather than a dead page. Keep that pattern.

**Two gunicorn workers.** Anything with a timer or a background thread runs
twice unless it takes the leader lock in `hub/scheduler.py`. Same reason
`create_all()` is wrapped in a Postgres advisory lock — concurrent `CREATE
TABLE` produces a `pg_type_typname_nsp_index` unique violation on every deploy.

**Bubbles mount on late-rendered content.** Client 360, the SEO client page
and Image Creator draw panels from a fetch. `hub-help.js` runs a debounced
MutationObserver for this. A bubble added to a JS-rendered panel works; one
added before that observer existed did not.

**`audit.log()`'s first positional is `module`.** Passing `module=` in the
extras raises `TypeError` and silently zeroes cost tracking. Use `tool=`.

**Env var names drifted.** This deployment sets `PEXELS_API` and
`PIXABAY_API`; much of the code was written against `..._API_KEY`. Config
accepts both. If a provider reports "no API key set" while the key is clearly
present, that's the cause.

**Placeholder values are worse than blanks.** `CLOUDINARY_URL` sat at
`cloudinary://API_KEY:API_SECRET@CLOUD_NAME` and every "is it configured?"
check said yes. `hub/config.py` detects the known placeholders. Render also
stores quotes literally — `SCANS_CALLBACK_TOKEN="abc"` includes the quotes,
which silently breaks callback matching.

**Absent data must read as "not measured", not zero.** A clean-looking zero
is a wrong answer presented confidently.

**The Render disk is not backed up. The database is.** Render backs up managed
Postgres; the 5 GB disk at `/var/data` is outside that, and a plan change,
region move or resize hands back an empty one. Anything whose only copy was a
JSON file on that disk was unrecoverable — and it fails *silently*, because a
module reading a missing file shows an empty list, not an error. Write JSON
through `hub/jsonstore.py`, which mirrors each write into the database and
restores on a miss. Pass `durable=False` only for something genuinely
rebuildable, and say in a comment what rebuilds it. `/api/integrity` flags any
module still writing its own; `/api/backup` and `/diagnostics` say what is
actually mirrored.

**Deleting a mirrored file needs `jsonstore.delete_json`, not `os.remove`.**
Removing only the file leaves the database copy to be restored by the next
read, so the delete appears to work and then undoes itself. This is the one
way the backup can bite you.

**`os.environ.get("HUB_DATA_DIR", "data")` is not the data directory.**
`HUB_DATA_DIR` is unset on this service, so that spelling silently resolves to
`./data` inside the container and is wiped on *every deploy* — not merely if
the disk is recreated. Page Image Optimizer and Tickets both had it, which is
where their saved jobs and field map were going. Use `jsonstore.data_dir()`.

## Data sources, and which are stale

| Source | How it's read | Freshness |
|---|---|---|
| Knack products (IOs) | live API, `hub/knack_products.py` (object_135), export as fallback | current |
| Knack campaigns / websites | static JSON in `clients_app/data/` | **stale — nothing refreshes these** |
| Knack object_153 (website registry) | live API, `hub/knack_websites.py` | current |
| Knack tickets | live API, `hub/knack_api.py` | current |
| Insites scans | own SQLite/Postgres tables | current |
| GoHighLevel | live API | current |

**The static JSON exports are the biggest known problem.** Products are now
read live: `hub/knack_data.search_client()` prefers `hub.knack_products`
(object_135) and falls back to the export, and Client 360 labels which source
it used — before that, a client's insertion orders showed the last export's
line-up while the Knack pull reported success, because the two are different
sources and only one was live. **Campaigns and websites still come from the
export**, so the same trap remains for them; both need their Knack object IDs.

**The URL is the join key, not the name.** Eleven field names hold a URL
across this codebase (`url`, `domain`, `website`, `web_url`, `site_url`…).
`hub/client_context.canonical_domain()` is the single place that decides what
a domain means. Name matching produces false positives — "Riverside HVAC" vs
"Riverside HVAC LLC" — and is why billing audits report phantom problems.

## Opportunistic migration — read this before editing any module

`hub/storage.py` (Cloudinary), `hub/images.py` (resize/convert),
`hub/jsonstore.py` (persisted JSON) and `hub/config.py` (settings) are the
shared implementations. **They are used by almost none of the modules.** Instead, 15 modules configure Cloudinary
themselves, 6 have their own resize code, and 55 files read environment
variables directly.

This has already caused real bugs twice. The "cap the longest edge before
converting" rule had to be found and fixed in several places separately. And
when the Pexels key was named `PEXELS_API` rather than `PEXELS_API_KEY`, the
fix went into `hub/config.py` — and the tool was still broken, because Image
Creator never called `config.py`. It had to be fixed a second time.

**The rule: when you are already editing a module for another reason, move
that module's Cloudinary, image and settings code onto the shared versions
while you are in there.** Not as a separate project — a big-bang rewrite of 22
working modules is risk with no feature at the end of it. But never leave a
module you have just touched still doing its own thing.

What that means in practice:

    cloudinary.config(...) + cloudinary.uploader.upload(...)
        -> from hub.storage import put;  put(data, kind="seo_images", ...)

    Image.open(...).save(..., "WEBP")
        -> from hub.images import optimise;  optimise(data, max_edge=1600)

    os.environ.get("PEXELS_API_KEY")
        -> from hub.config import settings;  settings.pexels_key
           (config already accepts every spelling in use)

    open(path, "w") + json.dump(...)   /   open(path) + json.load(...)
        -> from hub import jsonstore
           jsonstore.write_json(path, data)   # atomic, and mirrored
           jsonstore.read_json(path, default=[])
           jsonstore.delete_json(path)        # never bare os.remove

    base = "/var/data" if os.path.isdir("/var/data") else .../"data"
        -> jsonstore.data_dir("my_module")

If a shared function does not do what the module needs, extend the shared one
rather than keeping the local copy. That is the whole point — the next fix
should land once.

## The one module that is not Python

The **Display Ad Builder** (`modules/ad_builder`) is a Node service, not a
Flask module. It is ~10,000 lines of TypeScript with a native image pipeline
(sharp rasterises SVG and steps a quality ladder until each ad fits the
platform's file-weight limit -- Amazon allows 40 KB for some placements), so
porting it to Pillow would change creative that clients already receive.

It runs as a **second process in the same container**. `docker-start.sh` starts
it on 127.0.0.1 with a restart loop and then execs gunicorn as PID 1;
`hub/ad_builder_proxy.py` proxies `/tools/display-ads/*` to it behind the Hub
login and adds the admin token server-side, so nobody needs a second password.

Things that follow from that, each of which has a comment where it lives:

- **Two processes, one plan.** This costs ~150-200 MB of image and a second
  build step. If Render builds start timing out or memory gets tight, the ad
  builder ships its own `render.yaml` and can move to its own service --
  only `AD_BUILDER_URL` changes. Nothing else in the Hub knows the difference.
- **The pages link from the site root.** `fetch('/api/render')` is correct
  standalone and wrong under a mount, so `src/basepath.ts` injects a shim that
  prefixes fetch, XHR and href/src/action from `X-Forwarded-Prefix`. Without
  it the tool loads perfectly and no button does anything.
- **`ADBUILDER_ADMIN_TOKEN` must be set** (16+ characters) or the renderer
  refuses its own internal routes. `/status` says so in words.
- **The client and proposal joins are Python**, in `hub/ad_builder_link.py`.
  The renderer never learns who our clients are; finished ads are filed into
  the client gallery through `modules/image_picker/filing.file_asset`, which
  records the public_id Cloudinary already has rather than re-uploading.

## Conventions

- **No new Python dependencies** unless genuinely unavoidable.
- Module layout: `modules/<name>/app.py` (Flask app or blueprint),
  `templates/`, mounted in `wsgi.py` with a try/except and `_fallback_app()`.
- New tools get a tile in `hub/templates/tools.html` under the right group.
  A tool with no tile is invisible — six were, for weeks.
- Anything producing client work should call `audit.log(...)` with
  `client=` so it appears on that client's 360 record.
- Summary first, detail behind a click. Label absent data explicitly.
- Guard boot-time failures, but **record them** — a swallowed exception is how
  `/signup` 404'd for a day with no clue why.

## Verifying a change

Booting the app catches what static analysis misses; several serious bugs were
only found by running it.

```bash
python3 -c "import ast,pathlib; [ast.parse(p.read_text(errors='ignore')) \
  for p in pathlib.Path('.').rglob('*.py') if '_attic' not in p.parts]"
node --check hub/static/*.js
```

Then boot through `wsgi.application` (not just the hub app — that's how mount
shadowing hides) and request the pages you touched. `/api/integrity` reports
known defect patterns; `/login/health` diagnoses sign-in without a session.

## Delivery

`git push` from the sandbox has always been blocked, so releases have gone out
as zips uploaded through GitHub's browser UI. **That uploader adds and
overwrites but never deletes**, which is why the repo root accumulated 65
stray files. If you can push directly, do — it removes the whole class of
problem.
